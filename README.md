# Shower Cost Calculator

This is a very compact and simple shower cost calculator.
It uses no frameworks, no additional files, just a single HTML-file containing everything needed: CSS, Javascript, Images, even Font-files!  
It can be run on any modern operating system that has a web-browser.
In my opinion, this is the most ideal way to have a simple calculator software.

So why using bulky, closed-source apps, when a single open-source html-file can do the job?

## Compatibility
Works on desktop and mobile devices.
